**WARNING: VIBE CODED PROJECT**

This project is deliberately "vibe coded", as an experimental Go+Vue reimplementation of the "hand-coded" stable application "Sicroc" (which is built on the LAMP stack).

I wanted to gain real world 1st hand experience of "vibe coding" so I could better understand the tradeoffs and benefits of this approach.

Most of the code is "human reviewed", but it is not "human written" in the traditional sense. This may mean nothing to you and you may not care, but I believe in full disclose on the usage of AI in software development so that people can make informed decisions about the software they use. This is not how I normally write software.
